# Automated Testing Project - BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) - Borbey Robert - Dataspot.ro

In this project I will be implementing positive and negative tests for the following functionalities :

- Authentication
- Registration
- Search box
- Sort By

# How to use and clone the project? How to run the tests and access the reports?

1. _To utilize the project_, open it in PyCharm and ensure that all dependencies are installed. 
This can be done by running the following command in the terminal: _pip install -r requirements.txt_ . It is recommended to create a virtual environment (venv)
for the project and install necessary packages from Selenium.

2. _Cloning the project_ is done by following these steps:
- Open PyCharm and access the "Check out from Version Control" option from the VCS menu.
- Choose "GitHub" and enter the URL to the GitHub repository containing the project.
- Select the local location where you want to clone the project and click "Clone".

3. _To install the HTML formatter for BEHAVE_, you have to run the following command in the terminal:
##### _pip install behave-html-formatter_
This step is essential to format the reports generated by BEHAVE in a readable and accessible manner.

4. _Creating the behave.ini file_ is done by opening a text file and adding the following content to it:
##### _[behave.formatters]_
##### _html=behave_html_formatter:HTMLFormatter_

5. _Running the tests and generating the reports_ involves using the following command in the terminal to run the automated tests and generate an HTML report named "behave-report.html" :
##### _behave -f html-o behave-report.html_

6. After running the tests, you can _access the reports_ by opening the "behave-report.html" file mentioned above in a web browser. It will contain the test results and can be customized by modifying the file.

# How to open the project's test execution report without having to download it ?

The easiest method I've found is to use the following website to preview the report:

##### https://htmlpreview.github.io/

The report's URL - https://github.com/RobertBorbey/BDD_project_Dataspot/blob/main/behave-report.html
